# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-
This code uses a bit mask to represent the set of visited cities, so it can solve the problem in O(n^2 * 2^n) time, where n is the number of cities.

In the real world, with a large number of cities, we might opt for heuristic or approximation methods like Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization,
and Genetic Algorithms, 
which can give good solutions in a reasonable time, albeit not guaranteeing the optimal solution
